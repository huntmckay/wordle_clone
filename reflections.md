1. pathlib is a way to respresent system plaintext files as objects. 
    This project probably could have just used "with open()"

2. rich is a terminal library to make TUI applications
    I feel like I barely scratched the surface but really liked how clean the output looked. 
    I want to use this in another project in the future.

3. doctesting was very cool and way to test how function should work while also documenting
    python3 -m doctest -v wyrdle.py
